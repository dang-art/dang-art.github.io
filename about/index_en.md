### Artistic approach

Combining profound contemplation and sophisticated crafting skill, he creates paintings that express his view on: life as well as life cycle, human destiny, time and moment meaning, etc.

Some of symbolic images he uses in painting include:
- Depth is usually not a spatial concept but instead a time dimension.
- Geometrical primitives are combined to represent the time and moment.
- A human living is described by a 'two-face circle' representing the soul and physical existence and containing in its own emotion, belief, dream, etc.

### Materials: 

Paintings are performed on black canvas combined with blended materials including oil, white sand, acrylic, grue, etc.
